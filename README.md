# TelegramBotParser

The bot parses a specific site with reviews.
At startup, the user needs to start writing the name of the company and the bot offers to select specific organizations, one way or another related in meaning to the written user.

Once selected, the bot displays all reviews as a pagination message.
Restriction on receiving content - 1 request per day.

The bot also has a built-in Tranzzo payment system for convenient payment for a subscription.
